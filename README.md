# Songs Classifier Project
# Description
This Jupyter notebook, SongsClassify.ipynb, is part of a machine learning project aimed at classifying songs based on their lyrics and metadata. The notebook includes preprocessing of song lyrics, feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization, and song classification using a RandomForestClassifier.

# Technologies Used
Python
scikit-learn for machine learning
NLTK for natural language processing
Joblib for model serialization
Pandas for data manipulation
NumPy for numerical operations
Dataset
The dataset includes various attributes of songs such as Title, Singers, Lyrics, and Metaphors. Each song is labeled based on the metaphorical content present in the lyrics.

# Model
The machine learning model used is a RandomForestClassifier, chosen for its efficacy in handling both numerical and categorical data. The notebook details the process of splitting the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance
